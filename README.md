# Cluster Server Application

## Overview

This project is a scalable cluster server built with Node.js and Express. It leverages the power of clustering to efficiently manage multiple processes across multiple CPU cores, ensuring high performance and reliability for serving APIs or web content.

## Features

- **Scalability:** Utilizes Node.js clustering to automatically scale the number of worker processes based on system resources.
- **Express Framework:** Built on top of the popular Express framework for handling HTTP requests efficiently.
- **Mongoose Integration:** Supports MongoDB database operations through Mongoose, enabling easy data manipulation and management.
- **Environment Variables:** Uses dotenv for managing environment-specific configurations securely.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system. You can download it from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/mastervishu/cluster-server.git
   cd cluster-server
   ```

2. Install the dependencies.
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Copy the `.env.example` file to create your own `.env` file for environment variables.
   ```
   cp .env.sample .env
   ```

4. Update the `.env` file with your MongoDB connection string and other necessary configurations.

5. Start the development server.
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

## Usage

Once the server is running, you can interact with it using various endpoints defined in the routes. For example, to test the health check endpoint, send a GET request to `/api/v1/health`.
